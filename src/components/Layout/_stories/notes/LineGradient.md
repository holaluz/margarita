# Line Gradient

Line Gradient is used as a brand element around the web. There're 3 heights: small (1px), medium (.5rem) and large (1.5rem).

Small is often used as a decorator after a cover img (e.g holaluz.com/autoconsumo/)

Medium is used to visually split content between two white backgrounds as in the new Home (e.g https://zpl.io/2yl9679)

Large is used to strengthen big white texts displayed on img or video backgrounds as in the new Home. This enhances legibility, so improves accessibility (e.g https://zpl.io/2yl9679)
