# Design Principles

Did you hurt your head? Okay, alright, I’ll prove it to you. Look at my driver’s license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven’t even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Oh. Actually, people call me Marty. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.

Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Ohh, no. There’s that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth’s gravitational pull? What a nightmare. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I’ll throw the rope down to you.

Science Fiction Theater. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I’m wearing? Aw yeah, everything is great. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.

Hi, it’s really a pleasure to meet you. We never would have fallen in love. Flux capacitor. Uh, Doc. Excuse me.
