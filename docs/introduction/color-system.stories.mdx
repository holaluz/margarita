### Holaluz Gradient

Corporative gradient of Holaluz. Use this color for emphasise an interactive element inside a screen. It will have more importance than the primary color (pink-base). Think about it like a super primary.

This color also can be used decoratively: to make section breaks, headers, box borders, and text style.

A little story: This gradient has 3 colors because we wanted to pass accesibilty when putting white text on it. So we invented 2 new colors for the color palette in order to pass AA score. Don't hate us.

### Green Energy Gradient

This is the "Green Energy" gradient of Holaluz. We don't use it as part of the interface colors because it is more part of the brand.

It can be used as background for headers and sections, text style and as an icon color when the context is about Green Energy.
