## Design

### Using the design library in your Figma projects

In order to do that, we will need to give you view permissions and then, the library will be accessible in your asset libraries. We hope in a few months we can share the Library with the Figma Community.

#### Only use the Margarita Components

You will see 3 main categories when browsing our library. Tokens, Components, and Library Components.

- **Tokens**: are all the core values needed to construct and maintain a design system â€” spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. â€” represented as data.
- **Components**: These are the pieces you can use to create interfaces.
    - **In Margarita:** components ready to use in both design and front-end.
    - **In Kalimotxo:** components with Holaluz's Business Logic.
    - **In Component Parking:** Components that are used ad-hoc in particular projects and are waiting to be drafted as Margarita components. **Use these components exceptionally, because they're not implemented in Margarita yet and availability depends on the project you are working on.**
- **Library components**: These components are only used to maintain the library visually. Do not use them for building interfaces.

### Adding more components in the library

At the moment, we are not allowing external users to contribute to our design system with new components or improvements as we are still creating a stable version and finding the most efficient way to contribute to our design flow. 

Nevertheless, feel free to comment or share with us anything you want via email at productdesign@holaluz.com
