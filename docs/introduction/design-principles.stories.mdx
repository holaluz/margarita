# Design Principles

## Our principles

üë• ACCESIBLE üíò CONSIDERATE ü§ù RELIABLE üìê MEASURABLE üîÑ ITERABLE ‚öñÔ∏è CONSISTENT üßò SIMPLE

## Design for everyone

Holaluz is for everyone. Make sure that people with different social, physical, mental health and/or learning needs can use our designs.

- Don't give feedback only with color, use semantic icons.
- Use inclusive language, easy to understand and without technical jargon, both in images and texts.
- Hierarchize and distribute the content correctly to facilitate understanding

## Focus on user needs, not assumed solutions.

Use research techniques to empathize and understand the needs of our users and design accordingly.

- Question every task if they don't put the user at the center.
- Use, ask for and/or collect qualitative data - Include Hotjar (incoming & surveys).
- If possible, talk to those who will use the product: agents, end users, internal Holaluz users....

## Design for trust

Our main goal as a company is to build trust with our clients and within our own team.

Don't jeopardize this by using bad methodologies or practices: design interfaces that are (and feel) trustworthy. For example:

- If something goes wrong, give clear instructions on how to correct it, but avoid technical details.
- Be transparent in explaining products and services
- Correct errors that undermine trust in an interface, such as unclear texts, incorrect translations, animations that affect performance...

## Design with data

Let data drive decision making, not assumed solutions or hunches. This means:

- Measure everything you design, both in production and through testing using the various tools at our disposal.
- Start every project from a data-driven perspective: confirm the current data and develop the hypothesis that defines the goal to be achieved.

Always remember that data explains the past, not the future, so don't be blinded by it.

## Design, learn, iterate

The best way to create good products is to start small and iterate. Launch an MVP as soon as possible, test with real users, collect data and improve it.

- Work together with the PM/O to define what is the minimum needed for the story to deliver value.
- Be an *owner* of the *user story* and, if it needs to be iterated / keep an eye on the data, write the *user stories* and don't forget that project as an MVP.
- Use *continuous research* and collect data and experiments [in Notion](https://www.notion.so/holaluz/Product-Design-9d76023b9dcf408ea2bed85e34598dc8?p=8fcf3711c19143018df4a892e4b90aea).

## Be consistent, but don't bore.

We design for humans, not robots. Consistency and use of common design patterns is key to usability, but always remember to add some *magic*.

- Use the *tokens* and components established in the *Design System*.

## Work hard to make it simple

At Holaluz we don't sell a simple product/service: energy is complex and its terminology can be confusing. Strive for simplicity and don't make people overthink everything.

Aim for a better understanding of Holaluz's brand, narrative and product/service.
