# The official way to build web experiences in Holaluz

Margarita is the web implementation of the Holaluz's Design System. Our primary goal is to create a system that can be used to build consistent, accessible, and performant web user experiences for our users, delivering value as fast as we can.

DISCLAIMER: While Margarita is open source, its purpose is to improve code quality, consistency, and cross-team collaboration at Holaluz. Thus, it’s likely that we will introduce breaking API changes more often than usual.

## **About Margarita**

- Built on top of [@vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/).
- Uses [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to develop, showcase, and test each component.
- Unit testing based on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Vue Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/vue-testing-library).
- The design library is built using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/7RhweKibaUnxX6WYBl7zKW/Design-System-Beta?node-id=12%3A3).

## Changelog

Margarita follows semantic versioning. In short, this means we use patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for breaking changes. You can see changes here.
