# Welcome

Margarita is the UI Library from Holaluz.

Check out [component examples](https://holaluz.github.io/margarita/).

**WARNING**: While Margarita is open source, its purpose is to improve code quality, consistency, and cross-team collaboration at Holaluz. Thus, itâ€™s likely that we will introduce breaking API changes more often than usual.

## About Margarita

* Built on top of [@vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/).
* Uses [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to develop, showcase, and test each component.
* Unit testing based on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Vue Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/vue-testing-library).
