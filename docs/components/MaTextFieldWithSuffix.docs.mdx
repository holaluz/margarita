# TextField-with-suffix

## Description

Input field with independent (from the value) and fixed (always visible) suffix. 
The suffix itself can be either text, symbols or both.

## How to use it? (Controls)

We can edit the same items from the text-field + the **suffix**.

- Aria label
- Edit label
- Edit placeholder value
- Add and edit suffix
- Error message
- State

If the user misses that the input already has a suffix and enters it ‚Üí Allow this in our validation and do not show an error.

‚ö†Ô∏è  **How not to use it**

- Do not rely only on suffixes, some users will not read them.
- Suffixes will not replace labels. If you need a specific type of information, say so in the input label or hint/helper text as well.

## When to use it

- When there is a commonly understood symbol or abbreviation for the type of information we are asking for.
- When the user needs to enter a value which has specific units.

***For example:***

The user wants to put solar panels on their rooftop and the total cost is 8.000‚Ç¨. They need to specify how much they want to pay at the moment (the rest will be financed).

üëâ The user needs to enter an amount and whatever the amount ‚Üí it will be ‚Ç¨ ‚Üí so we fill the unit for them.
