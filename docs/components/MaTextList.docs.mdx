## How to use it? (Controls)

- **Tag:** Set the HTML element tag to ensure the document semantics are meaningful
    - ul → To present content of equal status or value.
    - ol → Imply sequence and order, and are commonly used when giving a set of instructions.
- **Size:** Sets the text element size according to our Design System
    - MaText-Medium, MaText-Small
    - The use of any MaHeading or MaText-xSmall is strictly forbidden.
- **Tone:** Sets the text element color tone (check text-tones). This also applies to symbols of the bullet lists
- **Icon:** Sets the icon used for ul element. Can be bullet point or checkmark.

## When to use it

### ul (Unordered Lists or Bullet Lists)

→ To present content of equal status or value.

- Use bulleted lists when you don’t need to convey a specific order for list items.
- Use bullets when is just a list of items.
- Use checkmarks when the text is talking about things that are

### ol (Ordered Lists or Numbered Lists)

→ Imply sequence and order, and are commonly used when giving a set of instructions.

- Use numbered lists when you need to convey a priority, hierarchy, or sequence between list items

Generally, lists should be used to present simple pieces of information. For more complex sets of data, consider using a [data-grid](https://holaluz.github.io/margarita/?path=/story/components-datagrid--datagrid)

Use list items that are grammatically parallel. For example, do not mix passive voice with active voice or declarative sentences (statements) with imperative sentences (direct command).


## Behavior


### Resizing

The width of the `<li>` element is defined by its parent but has a max-width of 75ch to have proper legibility.

### Order

- Arrange list items in a logical way. For example, if the list is about resource use, the default order might be highest resource use to lowest.
- Grouping items in categories into smaller, more specific lists might be more meaningful in some contexts. Alternatively, organize in alphabetical or numeric order.
