# List

Lists are vertical groupings of related text content. List items begin with either a number or a symbol (bullet or checkmark).

## How to use it? (Controls)

- **Tag:** Set the HTML element tag to ensure the document semantics are meaningful
    - ul â†’ To present content of equal status or value.
    - ol â†’ Imply sequence and order, and are commonly used when giving a set of instructions.
- **Size:** Sets the text element size according to our Design System
    - MaText-Medium, MaText-Small
    - The use of any MaHeading or MaText-xSmall is strictly forbidden.
- **Tone:** Sets the text element color tone (check text-tones). This also applies to symbols of the bullet lists
- **Icon:** Sets the icon used for ul element. Can be bullet point or checkmark.

List items are HTML elements passed as slot. Each node is transformed in a list item.

ðŸ‘€ The use of MaText for list items is **recommended**. By default, the color and size are set according to the properties specified in the MaList component specified above (tone/size). If a custom configuration is needed, tone and size for the designated MaText can be set as explained [here](https://holaluz.github.io/margarita/?path=/story/components-text--text).
(The same behaviour is reproduced with customized styles for any other HTML elements.)

## When to use it

### ul (Unordered Lists or Bullet Lists)

â†’ To present content of equal status or value.

- Use bulleted lists when you donâ€™t need to convey a specific order for list items.
- Use bullets when is just a list of items.
- Use checkmarks when the text is talking about things that are

### ol (Ordered Lists or Numbered Lists)

â†’ Imply sequence and order, and are commonly used when giving a set of instructions.

- Use numbered lists when you need to convey a priority, hierarchy, or sequence between list items

ðŸ‘€ Generally, lists should be used to present simple pieces of information. For more complex sets of data, consider using a [data-grid](https://holaluz.github.io/margarita/?path=/story/components-datagrid--datagrid)

ðŸ‘€ Use list items that are grammatically parallel. For example, do not mix passive voice with active voice or declarative sentences (statements) with imperative sentences (direct command).


## Behavior


### Resizing

The width of the `<li>` element is defined by its parent but has a max-width of 75ch to have proper legibility.

### Order

- Arrange list items in a logical way. For example, if the list is about resource use, the default order might be highest resource use to lowest.
- Grouping items in categories into smaller, more specific lists might be more meaningful in some contexts. Alternatively, organize in alphabetical or numeric order.
