# Spacing

Consistent spacing creates visual balance, rythm and visual understanding that makes the user interface (UI) easier for our users to scan.

---

#### Create visual rhythm

We use incrementally measured spacing to create harmonious arrangements of components and text. This gives the elements a predictable rhythm, which makes the experience as a whole feel intentional and well designed.

#### Precise but flexible

Beyond mathematical precision, spacing also reacts to the objects it surrounds, giving more space to larger objects, less to small. Optical adjustments can also be made if an element looks off and the spacing needs a nudge to make things feel right.

#### The spacing system

All spacing for components and typography is done in increments of 4 pixels. This forms the basic unit of measurement for spacing.

## Layout Spacing

<div style={{display: 'grid', gridAutoFlow: 'rows', gap: '2rem', marginTop: '1.5rem'}}>
{
  Object.entries(spacing).map(([tokenName,tokenValue]) => (
    <div style={{display: 'grid', gridAutoFlow: 'column', gap: '3rem', maxWidth: '600px', alignItems: 'center', gridTemplateColumns: '4rem 11rem 4rem'}}>
      <span>{tokenName}</span>
      <div style={{width: tokenValue, height: tokenValue, backgroundColor: 'var(--color-gray-light)', justifySelf: 'center'}}/>
      <span>{tokenValue}</span>
    </div>
    )
  )
}
</div>


## How to choose spacing

Use less space between small components, or components that share a close functional relationship.

Coordinate small and large values, along with structural components (like Home cards), to create visual groupings of related things. This helps merchants understand the interface and more easily find what theyâ€™re looking for. For screens with specialized layouts, adjust overall spacing based on the density of the content. For example, a simple login screen on desktop display has more room to breathe, so more space can be used.
